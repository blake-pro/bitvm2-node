VARIABLES
    msg,            \* local-queue state of the {graph_id}_KickoffSent message
    spvLags,        \* kickoff_height >= goat_confirmed_btc_height (GOAT SPV not strictly past the kickoff)
    challengeSent,  \* verifier broadcast send_challenge_tx for this unauthorized kickoff
    take1           \* operator completed the uncontested Take1 (unauthorized withdrawal)

vars == <<msg, spvLags, challengeSent, take1>>

TypeOK ==
    /\ msg \in MsgStates
    /\ spvLags \in BOOLEAN
    /\ challengeSent \in BOOLEAN
    /\ take1 \in BOOLEAN

\* detect_kickoff enqueued KickoffSent to Actor::All; at first confirm GOAT
\* SPV lags the Bitcoin tip (the common case, and the == case the strict `>`
\* also skips); withdraw status for this graph is the unauthorized None.
Init ==
    /\ msg = "Pending"
    /\ spvLags = TRUE
    /\ challengeSent = FALSE
    /\ take1 = FALSE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* GOAT SPV eventually catches up to the already-confirmed kickoff (the lag
\* always closes with time).
SpvCatchesUp ==
    /\ spvLags
    /\ spvLags' = FALSE
    /\ UNCHANGED <<msg, challengeSent, take1>>

\* BUGGY handle_kickoff_sent_verifier: consumes the message either way. When
\* SPV still lags it returns Ok(()) with no defer -> Processed, NO challenge;
\* only when SPV is strictly past does it send the Challenge.
VerifierProcessBuggy ==
    /\ msg = "Pending"
    /\ msg' = "Processed"
    /\ challengeSent' = (IF spvLags THEN challengeSent ELSE TRUE)
    /\ UNCHANGED <<spvLags, take1>>

\* FIXED (issue's suggested fix): on None/Canceled while SPV is not strictly
\* past the kickoff, push_local_unhandled_messages_with_reason - i.e. DEFER,
\* leaving the message Pending to be retried - so the verifier only finalises
\* the message once SPV has caught up and the Challenge is actually sent.
VerifierProcessFixed ==
    /\ msg = "Pending"
    /\ ~spvLags
    /\ msg' = "Processed"
    /\ challengeSent' = TRUE
    /\ UNCHANGED <<spvLags, take1>>

\* After the ConnectorA CSV the operator broadcasts Take1. It is an
\* unauthorized withdrawal only if no Challenge was ever sent (a sent
\* Challenge forces the long dispute path; per the issue the CSV margin is
\* adequate once the Challenge fires). The verifier's one-shot handling has
\* run to a final decision by the time Take1 is spendable (msg = Processed).
OperatorTake1 ==
    /\ msg = "Processed"
    /\ ~challengeSent
    /\ ~take1
    /\ take1' = TRUE
    /\ UNCHANGED <<msg, spvLags, challengeSent>>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* Safety (fail-open check): an unauthorized kickoff must never reach a
\* completed Take1 without the verifier's Challenge defense having fired.
\* Buggy: violated - process while SPV lags -> Processed, no Challenge,
\* never retried -> Take1. Fixed: holds - the message is deferred until the
\* Challenge is sent, so Take1's guard (Processed /\ ~challengeSent) is
\* never reachable.
NoUnauthorizedTake1 == take1 => challengeSent
