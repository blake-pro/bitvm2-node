## Overview

The BitVM2 Node (`bitvm2-noded`) is a multi-role distributed node that participates in the BitVM2 cross-chain bridge protocol. It enables trustless Bitcoin-to-L2 transfers through a combination of:

- **Multi-signature Consensus**: Committee-based transaction presigning
- **Optimistic Verification**: Watchtower monitoring with dispute resolution
- **ZK Proofs**: Cryptographic verification of state transitions
- **P2P Graph Distribution**: Decentralized graph data synchronization via relayer nodes

### Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **P2P Communication** | libp2p-based gossip network (Kademlia DHT + Gossipsub) |
| **Chain Monitoring** | Bitcoin and GOAT L2 event watching |
| **Graph Management** | Transaction graph creation, signing, and lifecycle tracking |
| **Graph Synchronization** | P2P-based graph distribution with relayer node support |
| **Challenge Processing** | Watchtower challenges and dispute resolution |
| **Proof Coordination** | ZK proof generation via proof-builder-rpc |

**Description**: The system employs a three-layer architecture. The Input Layer receives events from external chains, P2P network messages, and RPC requests. The Core Processing Layer dispatches messages to role-specific handlers. The Background Tasks Layer manages graph state machines, instance lifecycles, node health, and SPV header chain updates. All state is persisted to SQLite database, with graph data stored in a dedicated `graph_raw_data` table.

```

**Description**: Each role subscribes to its corresponding gossipsub topic for message exchange. All roles subscribe to the `/All` topic for broadcast messages. Relayer nodes (Committee members with `ENABLE_RELAYER=true`) respond to graph synchronization requests and distribute graph data across the network.

---

## Actor System

BitVM2 employs four primary actor roles plus an optional relayer capability:

### Fig-02-1-Actor-Roles

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Actor {
        <<enumeration>>
        Committee
        Operator
        Challenger
        Watchtower
        All
    }

    class Committee {
        +generate_nonces()
        +presign_transactions()
        +endorse_graph()
        +confirm_pegin()
    }

    class Operator {
        +create_graph()
        +push_data_to_l2()
        +broadcast_kickoff()
        +send_take1_take2()
    }

    class Challenger {
        +monitor_timeouts()
        +submit_disprove()
    }

    class Watchtower {
        +monitor_block_headers()
        +submit_challenge()
        +ack_nack_response()
    }

    class Relayer {
        +respond_sync_request()
        +distribute_graph_data()
        +cache_all_graphs()
    }

    Actor <|-- Committee
    Actor <|-- Operator
    Actor <|-- Challenger
    Actor <|-- Watchtower
    Committee <|-- Relayer : ENABLE_RELAYER=true
```

**Description**: The class diagram shows the inheritance relationship between the Actor enumeration and role implementations. Relayer is a special mode of Committee nodes enabled via environment variable.

### Role Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities | Key Messages |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| **Committee** | Multi-sig committee member, responsible for presigning and graph endorsement | `NonceGeneration`, `CommitteePresign`, `EndorseGraph` |
| **Operator** | Bridge operator, creates graphs and executes withdrawal transactions | `CreateGraph`, `KickoffSent`, `Take1Sent`, `Take2Sent` |
| **Challenger** | Dispute challenger, monitors timeouts and submits disproofs | `DisproveReady`, `DisproveSent` |
| **Watchtower** | Chain monitor, validates block headers and submits challenges | `WatchtowerChallengeSent` |
| **Relayer** | Graph data distributor, responds to sync requests | `SyncGraphRequest`, `SyncGraph` |

## Core Workflows

### Peg-in (Bridge-In)

Users deposit BTC into the bridge contract and receive equivalent assets on GOAT L2.

#### Fig-03-1-Pegin-Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant User
    participant GOAT as GOAT L2
    participant EW as Event Watch
    participant Committee
    participant Operator
    participant BTC as Bitcoin
    participant DB as SQLite DB

    User->>GOAT: Initiate BridgeInRequest
    GOAT-->>EW: Trigger BridgeInRequest event
    EW->>Committee: PeginRequest message

    Committee->>Committee: Validate fees and availability
    Committee->>Operator: ConfirmInstance

    Operator->>Operator: Create SimplifiedBitvm2Graph
    Operator->>DB: Store graph_raw_data (JSON)
    Operator->>Committee: CreateGraph (with graph data)

    loop Multi-sig rounds
        Committee->>Committee: NonceGeneration
        Committee->>Committee: CommitteePresign
    end

    Committee->>Operator: EndorseGraph (graph endorsement)
    Operator->>GOAT: PostGraphData
    Operator->>BTC: Broadcast PreKickoff transaction
    BTC-->>EW: PreKickoff confirmed

    Note over User,DB: Peg-in complete, user receives assets on L2
```

**Description**: The Peg-in flow consists of three phases: (1) Request Phase - user initiates request on L2, committee validates; (2) Graph Construction Phase - Operator creates transaction graph (stored locally in SQLite), committee performs MuSig2 multi-signing; (3) Confirmation Phase - data posted to L2, PreKickoff transaction confirms to complete the process.

#### Fig-03-2-Instance-BridgeIn-Status

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> UserIniting: User initiates request
    UserIniting --> UserInited: Event detected
    UserInited --> CommitteesAnswered: Enough committee responses
    UserInited --> NoEnoughCommitteesAnswered: Window timeout
    UserInited --> UserDiscarded: UTXO spent

    CommitteesAnswered --> UserBroadcastPeginPrepare: User broadcasts
    UserBroadcastPeginPrepare --> Presigned: All committees signed
    UserBroadcastPeginPrepare --> PresignedFailed: Signing failed

    Presigned --> RelayerL1Broadcasted: Relayer broadcasts
    RelayerL1Broadcasted --> RelayerL2Minted: L2 minting success
    RelayerL1Broadcasted --> RelayerL2MintedFailed: L2 minting failed

    UserBroadcastPeginPrepare --> Timeout: Timeout
    Timeout --> UserCanceled: User cancels

    RelayerL2Minted --> [*]
    UserCanceled --> [*]
```

**Description**: This state diagram shows the complete lifecycle of a bridge-in instance, from initial request through committee validation, signing, and final minting on L2.

### Peg-out (Bridge-Out)

Users initiate withdrawal on GOAT L2 and receive BTC on Bitcoin. Two paths exist:

#### Fig-03-3-Pegout-Happy-Path

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant User
    participant GOAT as GOAT L2
    participant Operator
    participant BTC as Bitcoin

    User->>GOAT: InitWithdraw (withdrawal request)
    GOAT-->>Operator: Withdrawal event detected

    Operator->>BTC: Broadcast Kickoff transaction
    Note over Operator,BTC: Wait for Timelock expiry

    alt No challenge (Happy Path)
        Operator->>BTC: Broadcast Take1 transaction
        BTC->>User: BTC transferred to user address
    end
```

**Description**: The Happy Path is the simplest route - when no Watchtower challenges the Operator's claim, the Operator completes the withdrawal via Take1 transaction after the Timelock expires.

#### Fig-03-4-Pegout-Challenge-Path

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant User
    participant GOAT as GOAT L2
    participant Operator
    participant Watchtower
    participant Challenger
    participant BTC as Bitcoin

    User->>GOAT: InitWithdraw
    Operator->>BTC: Kickoff transaction

    rect rgb(255, 240, 240)
        Note over Operator,Watchtower: Challenge Phase
        Operator->>BTC: WatchtowerChallengeInitTx

        loop For each Watchtower index
            Watchtower->>BTC: WatchtowerChallengeTx
            alt Operator accepts
                Operator->>BTC: ACK response
            else Operator rejects
                Operator->>BTC: NACK response
                Challenger->>BTC: DisproveTx
            end
        end

        Operator->>BTC: CommitBlockHashTx
        Operator->>BTC: AssertInitTx
        Operator->>BTC: AssertCommitTx
    end

    alt All challenges passed
        Operator->>BTC: Take2 transaction
        BTC->>User: BTC transferred to user address
    else Challenge failed
        Challenger->>BTC: DisproveTx
        Note over User,BTC: User funds safe, Operator penalized
    end
```

**Description**: The Challenge Path is triggered when Watchtowers detect anomalies. It contains three sub-phases: (1) Watchtower Challenge - watchers submit challenges; (2) BlockHash Commit - Operator commits block hash; (3) Assert Commit - Operator commits assertion proofs. Failure in any phase triggers Disprove.

### Challenge Process

#### Fig-03-5-Challenge-Substatus

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph WTC["Watchtower Challenge Phase"]
        WTC1["OperatorInit"] --> WTC2{"Watchtower response?"}
        WTC2 -->|"Submit challenge"| WTC3["Challenge"]
        WTC2 -->|"Timeout"| WTC4["ChallengeTimeout"]
        WTC3 --> WTC5{"Operator response?"}
        WTC5 -->|"ACK"| WTC6["OperatorACK"]
        WTC5 -->|"NACK"| WTC7["OperatorNACK"]
        WTC5 -->|"Timeout"| WTC8["ACKTimeout"]
    end

    subgraph CBH["CommitBlockHash Phase"]
        CBH1["WatchtowerChallengeProcessed"]
        CBH2["OperatorCommit"]
        CBH3["OperatorCommitTimeout"]
        CBH1 --> CBH2
        CBH1 --> CBH3
    end

    subgraph AC["Assert Commit Phase"]
        AC1["OperatorInit"]
        AC2["OperatorCommit"]
        AC3["OperatorCommitTimeout"]
        AC1 --> AC2
        AC1 --> AC3
    end

    WTC6 --> CBH1
    CBH2 --> AC1
    AC2 --> TAKE2["Take2 Success"]

    WTC4 & WTC7 & WTC8 & CBH3 & AC3 --> DISP["Disprove"]
```

**Description**: The challenge process tracks three parallel state machines. Any timeout or failure in sub-phases triggers the Disprove path, ensuring system security.

## Graph State Machine

Graph is the core data structure in BitVM2, representing a set of presigned Bitcoin transactions.

### Fig-04-1-Graph-Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> OperatorPresigned: Operator creates graph

    OperatorPresigned --> CommitteePresigned: Collected enough committee signatures
    OperatorPresigned --> Obsoleted: PreKickoff on-chain but data not posted

    CommitteePresigned --> OperatorDataPushed: Operator pushes L2 data
    CommitteePresigned --> Obsoleted: PreKickoff on-chain but data not posted

    OperatorDataPushed --> PreKickoff: PreKickoff tx confirmed
    OperatorDataPushed --> Obsoleted: Pegin not withdrawable and no withdrawal request

    PreKickoff --> OperatorKickOff: Kickoff tx broadcast
    PreKickoff --> Skipped: Guardian intervention or force skip

    OperatorKickOff --> OperatorTake1: Timelock expired without challenge
    OperatorKickOff --> Challenge: WatchtowerChallengeInit confirmed

    Challenge --> OperatorTake2: All challenge phases completed normally
    Challenge --> Disprove: WT-Ack/BlockHash-Commit/Assert Timeout or Fraud scripts detected

    OperatorTake1 --> [*]: Happy Path complete
    OperatorTake2 --> [*]: Challenge Path complete
    Skipped --> [*]: Graph skipped
    Obsoleted --> [*]: Graph obsoleted
    Disprove --> [*]: Dispute resolved
```

**Description**: Graph goes through 9 main states. The normal flow starts from `OperatorPresigned`, proceeds through signature collection, data publishing, and Kickoff, finally completing via Take1 (Happy Path) or Take2 (Challenge Path). Abnormal cases enter `Obsoleted`, `Skipped`, or `Disprove` terminal states.

### Fig-04-2-Graph-Status-Transitions

| Source State | Target State | Trigger Condition |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `OperatorPresigned` | `CommitteePresigned` | Received enough committee presignatures |
| `OperatorPresigned` | `Obsoleted` | PreKickoff on-chain but graph data not posted |
| `CommitteePresigned` | `OperatorDataPushed` | Operator successfully pushed data to L2 |
| `OperatorDataPushed` | `PreKickoff` | PreKickoff tx confirmed on Bitcoin |
| `OperatorDataPushed` | `Obsoleted` | Pegin not withdrawable and no withdrawal request |
| `PreKickoff` | `OperatorKickOff` | Kickoff tx broadcast successfully |
| `PreKickoff` | `Skipped` | Guardian intervention or force skip |
| `OperatorKickOff` | `OperatorTake1` | Timelock expired without challenge |
| `OperatorKickOff` | `Challenge` | WatchtowerChallengeInit tx confirmed |
| `Challenge` | `OperatorTake2` | All sub-phases completed normally |
| `Challenge` | `Disprove` | Timeout or challenge failure detected |

### Fig-04-3-Challenge-SubStatus-ER

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ChallengeSubStatus {
        WatchtowerChallengeStatus watchtower_challenge_status
        CommitBlockHashStatus commit_blockhash_status
        AssertCommitStatus assert_commit_status
        DisproveTxType disprove_type
        int disprove_index
    }

    WatchtowerChallengeStatus {
        enum None
        enum OperatorInit
        enum WatchtowerChallenge
        enum WatchtowerChallengeTimeout
        enum OperatorACKTimeout
        enum WatchtowerChallengeNormalFinished
        enum WatchtowerChallengeDisproveFinished
    }

    CommitBlockHashStatus {
        enum None
        enum WatchtowerChallengeProcessed
        enum OperatorCommit
        enum OperatorCommitTimeout
    }

    AssertCommitStatus {
        enum None
        enum OperatorInit
        enum OperatorCommit
        enum OperatorCommitTimeout
    }

    ChallengeSubStatus ||--|| WatchtowerChallengeStatus : contains
    ChallengeSubStatus ||--|| CommitBlockHashStatus : contains
    ChallengeSubStatus ||--|| AssertCommitStatus : contains
```

**Description**: `ChallengeSubStatus` aggregates three parallel status trackers. Only when `watchtower_challenge_status == NormalFinished`, `commit_blockhash_status == OperatorCommit`, and `assert_commit_status == OperatorCommit` can the system transition to `OperatorTake2` state.

## Graph Storage & Synchronization

Graph data is stored locally in SQLite and distributed via P2P messaging.

### Fig-05-1-Graph-Storage-Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Storage["SQLite Database"]
        GT[("graph table\n(Metadata, TxIDs, Status)")]
        GRD[("graph_raw_data table\n(Serialized JSON)")]
    end

    subgraph Operations["Graph Operations"]
        CREATE["store_graph()"]
        READ["get_graph()"]
        PARSE["parse_graph_raw_data()"]
        SERIALIZE["serialize_graph_raw_data()"]
    end

    subgraph P2P["P2P Synchronization"]
        REQ["SyncGraphRequest"]
        RESP["SyncGraph"]
        RELAY["Relayer Nodes"]
    end

    CREATE -->|"Atomic Transaction"| GT
    CREATE -->|"JSON Serialization"| GRD
    READ --> GT
    READ --> GRD
    PARSE -->|"spawn_blocking"| GRD
    SERIALIZE -->|"spawn_blocking"| GRD

    REQ -->|"Broadcast to All"| RELAY
    RELAY -->|"Lookup Local DB"| GRD
    RELAY -->|"Respond with Graph"| RESP
```

**Description**: Graph storage uses a two-table approach: `graph` for metadata/transaction IDs and `graph_raw_data` for full serialized graph JSON. Large graph serialization uses `spawn_blocking` to prevent async runtime blocking. P2P synchronization enables nodes to request missing graphs from relayer nodes.

### Fig-05-2-Graph-Sync-Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant NodeA as Node A (Missing Graph)
    participant P2P as P2P Network
    participant Relayer as Relayer Node
    participant DB as Relayer DB

    NodeA->>NodeA: Check local DB for graph
    Note over NodeA: Graph NOT FOUND

    NodeA->>P2P: SyncGraphRequest(instance_id, graph_id)
    P2P->>Relayer: Broadcast to All topic

    Relayer->>Relayer: is_relayer() check
    Note over Relayer: ENABLE_RELAYER=true

    Relayer->>DB: Query graph_raw_data
    DB-->>Relayer: Return serialized graph

    Relayer->>P2P: SyncGraph(instance_id, graph_id, graph_data)
    P2P->>NodeA: Deliver response

    NodeA->>NodeA: Validate graph_id on GOAT chain
    NodeA->>NodeA: store_graph() locally
    Note over NodeA: Graph synchronized!
```

**Description**: When a node lacks required graph data, it broadcasts a `SyncGraphRequest`. Relayer nodes (Committee members with `ENABLE_RELAYER=true`) respond with the full graph data via `SyncGraph` message. The requesting node validates and stores the graph locally.

### Graph Data Tables

#### graph table (Metadata)

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `graph_id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `instance_id` | UUID | Associated bridge instance |
| `status` | String | Current GraphStatus |
| `sub_status` | String | Challenge sub-status JSON |
| `operator_pubkey` | String | Operator's public key |
| `*_txid` | Txid | Transaction IDs for all graph transactions |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | i64 | Timestamps |

#### graph_raw_data table (Full Graph)

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `graph_id` | UUID | Primary key (FK to graph) |
| `raw_data` | TEXT | JSON-serialized SimplifiedBitvm2Graph |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | i64 | Timestamps |

## Message System

### Fig-06-1-Message-Structure

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class GOATMessage {
        +Actor actor
        +GOATMessageContent content
        +serialize_message() Vec~u8~
        +deserialize_message() GOATMessage
    }

    class GOATMessageContent {
        <<enumeration>>
        PeginRequest
        CreateGraph
        ConfirmInstance
        NonceGeneration
        CommitteePresign
        EndorseGraph
        GraphFinalize
        KickoffReady
        KickoffSent
        ChallengeSent
        DisproveReady
        DisproveSent
        Take1Sent
        Take2Sent
        SyncGraphRequest
        SyncGraph
        ...
    }

    class Actor {
        <<enumeration>>
        Committee
        Operator
        Challenger
        Watchtower
        All
    }

    GOATMessage --> Actor : target
    GOATMessage --> GOATMessageContent : payload
```

**Description**: The message system uses role-based addressing. Each message specifies a target role and content type, broadcast via Gossipsub to the corresponding topic. Messages are serialized using `serde_json` with `spawn_blocking` for large payloads.

## Build & Run

### Prerequisites

- Rust nightly-2025-06-30+
- ZKM toolchain (optional, for proof generation)

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build for regtest
BITCOIN_NETWORK=regtest cargo build -r

# Build for testnet4
BITCOIN_NETWORK=testnet4 cargo build -r

# Build only the node binary
cargo build -r -p bitvm2-noded
```

### Generate Node Keys

```bash
# Generate P2P peer key
bitvm2-noded key peer
# Output:
# PEER_KEY=<base64-encoded-key>
# PEER_ID=<peer-id>

# Generate funding address (for Operator/Challenger)
bitvm2-noded key funding-address
# Output:
# Funding address type=p2wpkh, address=bc1q...
```

### Start Node

```bash
bitvm2-noded \
  --rpc-addr 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --db-path ./node.db \
  --p2p-port 4001 \
  --bootnodes /ip4/x.x.x.x/tcp/4001/p2p/<peer_id>
```
